            My name is <b>Dylan Bateman</b>. I'm an undergraduate at the University of Missouri. I’m studying physics, with a focus in astronomy. I’m part of the College of Arts & Science. I plan to graduate after the Fall ‘24 semester. I’ve been tutoring other students in physics for 2 years now. I worked at Ellis Library as a shelving assistant for around 3 years before that. I also have been coding with <em>Python</em> for about a decade. More recently, I’ve gotten into <em>Java</em> and <em>C++</em> for a game I’m working on. I also enjoy tabletop role playing games, and have been running a campaign for over a year now. I also play in multiple other campaigns. I occasionally stream video games on Twitch. <br> I do not currently have a camera handy. I’m using my Vtuber avatar for the professional headshot for this assignment. I’m also using the Vtuber avatar for the professional video.

            I'm adding another paragraph of text because my current "About Me" text isn't long enough to show off the fact that my text is floating around the image to the left.
