    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
        My name is <b>Dylan Bateman</b>. I’m an undergraduate at the University of Missouri. I’m studying physics, with a focus in astronomy. I’m part of the College of Arts & Science. I plan to graduate after the Fall ‘24 semester. I’ve been tutoring other students in physics for 2 years now. I worked at Ellis Library as a shelving assistant for around 3 years before that. I also have been coding with <em>Python</em> for about a decade. More recently, I’ve gotten into <em>Java</em> and <em>C++</em> for a game I’m working on. I also enjoy tabletop role playing games, and have been running a campaign for over a year now. I also play in multiple other campaigns. I occasionally stream video games on Twitch. <br>
        I do not currently have a camera handy. I’m using my Vtuber avatar for the professional headshot for this assignment. I’m also using the Vtuber avatar for the professional video.
